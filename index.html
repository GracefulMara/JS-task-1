                <h2>What is JavaScript? </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a <strong>high-level, interpreted programming language</strong> that is one of the core technologies of the web alongside HTML and CSS. 
                    Initially designed to make web pages <em>interactive and dynamic</em>, however, it has evolved into a powerful, 
                    versatile language used for both <strong>client-side (frontend)</strong> and <strong>server-side (backend)</strong> development. 
                    While HTML provides the structure of a web page and CSS styles its appearance, 
                    JavaScript brings it to life by handling logic, animations, data manipulation, user interactions, and much more.

                <h2>Four Uses of JavaScript </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Interactive Web Pages (Frontend Web Development)</h3>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript's primary role is to create dynamic and interactive experiences on websites. 
                            This includes everything from simple animations and form validation to complex user interfaces, 
                            image sliders, dropdown menus and others. 
                            It makes websites feel responsive and engaging.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Server-Side Development (Backend with Node.js)</h3>
                        <p>
                            With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can run outside the browser, enabling server-side programming. 
                            This means you can use JavaScript to build entire web applications, manage databases, handle API requests, 
                            and perform server-related tasks, creating full-stack JavaScript solutions.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Mobile App Development (React Native, NativeScript, etc.)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Frameworks like React Native allow developers to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript. 
                            This significantly reduces development time and cost, as a single codebase can target multiple platforms.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Game Development</h3>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript is widely used for web-based game development, ranging from simple 2D games to more complex 3D experiences.
